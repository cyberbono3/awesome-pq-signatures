# Comparing & Benchmarking Post Quantum Digital Security Schemes

Benchmarking post-quantum signature schemes (Falcon-512, Dilithium, SPHINCS+ and more) with real performance numbers, sizes, security assumptions, implementation risks, and zkVM verification overhead to guide production-ready choices.

# PQ signatures
1. Lamport one-time signature scheme (“Lamport’s OTS”)
2. Winternitz one-time signature scheme (“Winternitz OTS”)
3. Leighton–Micali one-time signature scheme (LM-OTS)
4. Leighton–Micali signature scheme (LMS)
5. Hierarchical Signature Scheme (HSS) — hypertree variant of LMS
6. eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS)
7. XMSS^MT (shown as XMSS MT) — hypertree variant of XMSS
8. SPHINCS+ — standardized name SLH-DSA (“Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm”)
9. SPHINCS (the earlier SPHINCS scheme referenced as a predecessor)
10. HORS (“Hashing to Obtain a Random Subset”) — few-times signature scheme
11. HORST (“with Trees”) — Merkle-tree-based improvement over HORS
12. FORS (“Forest Of Random Subsets”) — few-times signature scheme used in SPHINCS+
13. Dilithium — standardized name ML-DSA (“Module-Lattice-based Digital Signature Algorithm”)
